                <p>
                    Today I am going to discuss internet scams. The key points are well-known scams, the consequences of a scam, and some advice on avoiding getting scammed online because this is a big and well-known problem that has arrived in the last 30 years. Internet scams are like others, but often a lot harder to spot or understand. It is especially old people who have not grown up with computers and other devices like smartphones who are often the biggest victims when it comes to scams. I know my grandparents would do some things on the internet that younger people would call foolish, or unintelligent, but that is because they don't understand how an email, username, or password works.</p><br>
                <p>
                    The most well-known internet scams. There are a lot of internet scams that exist, and every day, there is someone who has made a new type of internet scam. Some scams are just random, and has often a lot of bad writing, and not a lot of effort into writing something that someone could be that senseless to fall for, while others on the other hand are much more complicated and well-planned. Some scams even find a lot of information about the person they try to scam to sound professional and that it is not a scam, even though it is. I am pretty sure this is the most typical scam because they cost nothing to do other than a few minutes, so they just do it. This is called a phishing or a spoofing scam, and in the start, they can be harmless scams, but when they find a victim who is not intelligent enough to understand it is a scam, that is when they strike, and try much more complicated scam with a lot bigger consequence if they fall for it. (Fraud, 2021)
                    Other typical scams are winning prizes or other things. They are usually terrible, and they often ask you to pay a fee, give identity details, or give your finances so you can get the winnings like for example money or a computer worth 2000 dollars.

                        The consequence of getting scammed in a website scam is a wide range of things, and could be as little as some data, or something big like an account on something. When scammers get one of your accounts, and you are not able to get it back, that is when the scammers can scam you even more. They can often say that if you give them 500 dollars, you will get your account back, and if not, they are going to delete all your data, posts, and other things that you could lose from the account. But there are other consequences that are also very bad, because beyond finances, it has a big impact on people's mental health, and according to moneyandmentalhealth.org, 40 percent of victims felt stressed, ashamed, and embarrassed.</p><br>

                    There is a lot of things that you can do to prevent getting scammed, but this is very different from person to person and what works the best. To the “normal person,” I would highly recommend using 2FA or MFA (Two-factor authentication). This is maybe the best thing you could do to prevent it, while still using the internet. 2FA is authentication from two or more factors. Banks often have so that you need to approve a login on your computer or phone with face ID. But there are also other things like not opening emails from people you don't know, not pressing on links you are not sure about, using strong passwords with many characters, only buying from retailers you recognize, and thinking to yourself, is this too good to be true? Because if it is, it is probably not true.</p><br>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, internet scams are a big problem, and will as long as the internet exists be a big problem. What is important to do, is to maintain education to all about scamming, so that it will happen a lot less commonly than it does today. Remember to use 2FA, keep yourself updated on new scams, and when a scammer has your account, giving them money to get your account back is not a good idea. The scams often want you to hurry, and you have a bad time fixing a problem for example. They often do this not to let you think about if it is a scam or not before it is too late. I would recommend talking to someone about something like this if you are unsure if it is a scam or not and get other people's viewpoints of your situation.</p><br>
